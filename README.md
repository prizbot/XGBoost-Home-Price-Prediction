The given Python code demonstrates a complete workflow for a housing price prediction model using the kc_house_data dataset.
This dataset contains various features about houses such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area size, and more, which are used to predict the house prices. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the code:

Data Loading and Exploration:
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries (pandas for data manipulation, xgboost for machine learning, and matplotlib for visualization). The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named kc_house_data.csv into a pandas DataFrame. The first few rows of the dataset are displayed using data.head(), and basic information about the dataset such as the number of entries and data types is shown using data.info(). Missing values are checked using data.isnull().sum(), and summary statistics are obtained with data.describe().

Feature Selection:
Relevant features for the model are selected, and the target variable is defined. In this case, the features include 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'waterfront', 'view', 'condition', 'grade', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_basement', 'yr_built', 'yr_renovated', 'zipcode', 'lat', 'long', 'sqft_living15', and 'sqft_lot15'. The target variable is 'price'.

Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

Model Training:
The XGBoost library is used to create and train a regression model. The training and testing data are converted into DMatrix objects, which are optimized data structures used by XGBoost. Model parameters such as the objective function (reg:squarederror) and evaluation metric (rmse) are defined. The model is trained with 100 boosting rounds.

Model Evaluation:
Predictions are made on the test set, and the model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The RMSE is printed to show how well the model performs.

Visualization:
Actual vs. predicted prices for both training and test sets are plotted using matplotlib. These plots help in visually assessing the model's performance.

Prediction for a Single Instance:
The code also demonstrates how to predict the price for a single new house by creating a DataFrame with the required features and passing it through the trained model.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive example of building a machine learning model for house price prediction, including data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
